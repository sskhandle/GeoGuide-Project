**Download the app [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B60VzQes4ka7UU55ZERJM2ltd0E)**

GeoGuide will allow the user to find out information about the nearby surroundings.

It will quickly identify the userâ€™s position allowing the user to choose the nearest facility or business 
of his/her choice. Some of the proposed features that are planned for inclusion are Bank, Bar, Gas Station, 
Hospital, Hotel, Movie Theatre, Restaurant, Supermarket, Theatre or Taxi.

GeoGuide will show a list of all the businesses in the category that the user selects on the app, along with the 
distance of that business from the user location.

Using the Google Maps API, for every listing the user can choose to see its location on a Map as well as 
view the route to get to that destination.

The application has a fast response time, is easy to use and gives an accurate result. Thus GeoGuide is an ideal day-to-day companion for any user.
